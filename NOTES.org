* Requirements before course

** Windows users will need to install CYGWIN

but preferably they will switch to using mac/linux.

** Install R and Rstudio (or other editor of their choice).



* Ideal course?

Can we take the recent python course @ manchester and s/python/R/
updating where need be.

Would like to add section on Reproducible Research, e.g. with
Rmarkdown (easier to understand than latex).

SJE interested in tackling the testing section.  Will need to explore
the /testthat/ package.

* Teching needs

Can we find about 4 teachers to cover 1/2 day each?  Solicit help
from the mailing list...
